FMOD Studio is used to give the game an extremely flexible and dynamic audio system. With it and the very splendid API that FMOD provides for us, we can control practically anything. If you’re new to FMOD, I'd recommend checking out the [documentation](https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-studio) as a reference.

### Getting Started

1. Download/clone the source code for the game from the [main repository](https://github.com/Simoxus/scpcb-unity) (this repository is already included as a submodule, and you'll probably want to hear your events in-game)
2. Download [FMOD Studio](https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodstudio) (you might need to create an account first)
3. Once everything is downloaded, extract the source code
4. Navigate to the FmodStudio folder and open "ProjectUnity_FMOD.fspro"
